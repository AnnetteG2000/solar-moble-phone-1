        <h1>Solar Mobile Phone</h1>
        <p>
            A solar mobile phone is a type of mobile device that uses solar energy to recharge its battery. This innovative technology helps reduce dependence on traditional electricity sources and is especially useful in remote areas or during outdoor activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Solar mobile phones are equipped with small solar panels that convert sunlight into electrical energy. This energy is then stored in the phone's battery, allowing users to charge their devices on the go.
